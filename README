Installing Snapr
--------------------------------------------------

To install the Snapr plugin on your site, just extract the zip or tarball file
into your Enano root folder. If you need to upload Snapr manually, upload the
file plugins/Gallery.php and the entire folder plugins/gallery/ to the
plugins/ folder inside your Enano root.

To enable Snapr plugin, go to the Administration panel, expand General, click
Manage Plugins, and click Enable in the row showing the Snapr plugin.

Snapr was developed to be compatible with Enano 1.0, however the copy of Enano
it was developed under was a 1.0.1 Mercurial pull. If you experience
compatibility issues with Snapr, they'll probably be fixed with an upgrade to
the latest copy of Enano in the official Mercurial repository:

  <http://nighthawk.enanocms.org/hg/enano>

Using Snapr
--------------------------------------------------

The first thing you should do once you get the plugin enabled is go to Edit the
Sidebar and add a link to Special:Gallery (or Special.Gallery if you use the
Windows compatibility patch) using normal wikilink syntax. This will enable
users to access your gallery browser without having to search around. From
there, you can browse through the gallery (it's empty by default) and create
folders as needed. Images can be moved in between folders using the Edit Image
links on each image page or through the drop-down menu that shows when you
hover over an image title in the gallery browser.

Snapr also hooks into the sidebar and search subsystems. You can add a block to
your sidebar that shows a random image from Snapr's gallery by going to Edit
The Sidebar -> Create New Block, selecting Use Code from a Plugin, and
selecting "Random Image" from the dropdown menu. The search hook is automatic;
whenever you perform a search, image results will be displayed on the search
page.

Obtaining support
--------------------------------------------------

Support for Snapr is available via the same support channels as Enano, as it
is developed and maintained by the official Enano team. For support options,
both free and commercial, please see <http://enanocms.org/Contact_us>.

Have fun!
